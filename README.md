Movie Match is a web application designed for personal movie library management, rating films, and generating personalized recommendations. This project serves as the practical implementation for a Master's thesis titled: "A Comparative Performance Analysis of Relational and Graph Databases: A study of PostgreSQL and Neo4j".

Features
- Browse Movie Database: Access detailed information about productions, including descriptions, genres, and release years.
- Rating System: A star-based rating feature that directly influences the recommendation algorithm.
- Watchlist: Personalized lists for users to save movies they intend to watch in the future.
- Smart Recommendations: The system suggests films based on the user's past activity and ratings from similar profiles.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Vue.js (Progressive Framework) + Bootstrap (UI components and styling).
- Backend: Node.js (Runtime environment) + Express.js.
- Database: PostgreSQL – the relational database handling core business logic and user data.
- Containerization: Docker Desktop – the entire database environment is fully containerized to ensure test reproducibility.

Data Source:
The dataset used in this project, including movie information and user ratings, is sourced from the MovieLens website (provided by GroupLens Research).
